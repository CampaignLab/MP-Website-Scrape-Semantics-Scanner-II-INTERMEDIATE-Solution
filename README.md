The Python script code provides an intermediate solution, to the specified challenge. It uses appropriate libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and re for processing regular expressions. The data is stored in a JSON file named "ukmpprofile.json". Integrating with the ELK stack assumes you have the stack set up and will use the elasticsearch Python library to upload the data.

Key Features:
Scraping URLs: Extracts MP links from the provided URLs.
Regular Expressions: Searches for patterns like policy interests, key phrases, and statements.
JSON Storage: Saves the output in ukmpprofile.json.
ELK Integration: Uploads the data to the Elasticsearch index named uk-mp-profiles.
Prerequisites:
Install the required Python libraries:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 elasticsearch os
Ensure Elasticsearch is running and accessible at http://localhost:9200.
